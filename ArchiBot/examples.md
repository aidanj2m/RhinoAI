# RhinoAI Example Prompts

This document contains example prompts that can be used with RhinoAI to generate various geometric patterns and structures.

## Basic Shapes

### Prompt: Create a sphere with radius 10 at the origin

Expected outcome: A perfect sphere centered at (0,0,0) with radius 10 units.

### Prompt: Create a box with dimensions 20x30x10 centered at the point (5,5,0)

Expected outcome: A rectangular box with width 20, length 30, and height 10, centered at coordinates (5,5,0).

## Parametric Patterns

### Prompt: Create a honeycomb lattice structure with hexagons spaced 30 units apart

Expected outcome: A hexagonal grid pattern forming a honeycomb structure with consistent 30-unit spacing between cell centers.

### Prompt: Generate a spiral staircase with 20 steps, total height 50, and radius 20

Expected outcome: A helical staircase structure with 20 distinct steps, rising to a total height of 50 units, with radius of 20 units from center.

## Organic Structures

### Prompt: Create a wavy surface resembling ocean waves within a 100x100 area

Expected outcome: An undulating NURBS surface with varying heights, mimicking the appearance of ocean waves within a 100x100 unit square boundary.

### Prompt: Generate a tree-like branching structure with 3 levels of branches

Expected outcome: A fractal-like structure with a main trunk, primary branches, and secondary branches, resembling the structure of a tree.

## Architectural Elements

### Prompt: Create a domed roof with radius 50 and height 30

Expected outcome: A hemispherical or similar curved roof structure with radius 50 units and maximum height of 30 units.

### Prompt: Generate a series of columns spaced 20 units apart along a 100-unit curved path

Expected outcome: A row of cylindrical columns placed at regular 20-unit intervals along a curved path of 100 units total length.

## Mathematical Surfaces

### Prompt: Create a Möbius strip with width 10 and major radius 30

Expected outcome: A Möbius strip (a non-orientable surface with only one side) with width 10 units and major radius of 30 units.

### Prompt: Generate a Klein bottle with scale factor 20

Expected outcome: A representation of a Klein bottle (a non-orientable surface with no inside or outside) scaled to a factor of 20 units.

## Engineering Structures

### Prompt: Create a truss bridge spanning 200 units with 10 segments

Expected outcome: A truss-style bridge structure with supporting elements arranged in triangular patterns, spanning 200 units with 10 evenly spaced segments.

### Prompt: Generate a gear with 24 teeth and diameter 50

Expected outcome: A circular gear with 24 evenly spaced teeth and an overall diameter of 50 units.

## How to Use These Examples

1. Open Rhino 8
2. Type `RhinoAI` in the command line
3. When prompted, enter one of the example prompts from this document
4. Wait for RhinoAI to process your request and generate the geometry

You can also modify these examples by changing parameters, combining concepts, or creating entirely new prompts based on your specific needs.
